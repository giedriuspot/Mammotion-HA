## Usage üéÆ

### Getting Started
See the wiki for how to [get started](https://github.com/mikey0000/Mammotion-HA/wiki/Getting-Started)

Once the integration is set up, you can control and monitor your Mammotion mower using Home Assistant. üéâ

### Map display

This integration creates a `camera` entity that draws the mower's path and a companion `vacuum` entity for compatibility with map cards. When using the [Lovelace Xiaomi Vacuum Map card](https://github.com/PiotrMachowski/lovelace-xiaomi-vacuum-map-card), set the card's `entity` to the mower's vacuum entity and `camera_entity` to the map camera.

## Troubleshooting üîß

If you encounter any issues with the Mammotion integration, please check the Home Assistant logs for error messages. You can also try the following troubleshooting steps:

- Verify that you have Bluetooth proxy setup with Home Assistant.
- Ensure that your mower is connected to your home network and accessible from Home Assistant.
- Restart Home Assistant and check if the issue persists.

## PyMammotion Library üìö

This integration uses the [PyMammotion library](https://github.com/mikey0000/PyMammotion) to communicate with Mammotion mowers. PyMammotion provides a Python API for controlling and monitoring Mammotion robot mowers via MQTT, Cloud, and Bluetooth.

If the problem continues, please file an issue on the GitHub repository for further assistance. üôè
